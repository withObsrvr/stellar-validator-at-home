## Introduction

Welcome to Obsrvr's **Stellar Validator at Home** guide using Docker and Docker Compose!

This repository provides a comprehensive walkthrough for individuals and organizations interested in setting up a Stellar Validator node from the comfort of their own home using containerization. By leveraging Docker, you simplify the deployment process, ensure consistency across environments, and facilitate easier updates and maintenance.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Ease of Deployment**: Quickly set up and run your validator node with minimal configuration.
- **Containerization Advantages**: Isolate your node environment, manage dependencies efficiently, and simplify scaling.
- **Contribute to Network Security**: Strengthen the Stellar network by adding a new validator.
- **Community Engagement**: Join the global community of Stellar network participants.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Basic Docker Knowledge**: Familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Hardware**: A dedicated machine or virtual server.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later is recommended (Docker compatible OS).
- **Internet Connection**: Stable broadband connection.
- **Stellar Account**: Optional but recommended for network participation.

---

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](./images/docker_architecture_diagram.png)

*An overview of the components involved in running a Stellar Validator node using Docker.*

- **Stellar Core Container**: Runs the Stellar Core software.
- **PostgreSQL Container**: Serves as the database backend for Stellar Core.
- **Docker Network**: Facilitates communication between containers.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Optional containers for monitoring node performance and network status.

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

**Docker Installation:**

Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

**Docker Compose Installation:**

Docker Compose is now included with Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS. For Linux:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

Verify the installations:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obsrvr/stellar-validator-at-home.git
cd stellar-validator-at-home
```

### 3. Configure Stellar Core

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:

```bash
nano .env
```

### 3. Configure Stellar Core

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```


Generate a node seed (this will be your validator's unique identity):

```bash
docker run stellar/stellar-core:latest gen-seed
```


This command will output something like:

```
Secret seed: SDXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Public: GDXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Copy the output seed and paste it into the `.env` file where it says `NODE_SEED=`.

**Environment Variables:**

- `NODE_SEED`: Your node's secret seed (keep this secure).
- `NODE_IS_VALIDATOR`: Set to `true` to enable validation.
- `PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT`: Set to `true` to expose the HTTP port.
- `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`: The network passphrase (default is for the public network).
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.

**Example `.env` file:**

```ini
# Stellar Core Configuration
NODE_SEED=YOUR_NODE_SEED
NODE_IS_VALIDATOR=true
PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT=true
NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://stellar:stellar@postgres:5432/stellar

# Quorum Configuration
QUORUM_SET=["$self", "sdf1", "sdf2", "sdf3"]
THRESHOLD_PERCENT=67

# History Archives
HISTORY_ARCHIVE_URLS="https://history.stellar.org/prd/core-live/core_live_001/{0}"
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_NODE_SEED` with your actual node seed. Keep this seed secure and do not share it.

---

## Running the Validator

### 1. Start the Services

Use Docker Compose to build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:

- Build the Docker images (if not already built).
- Start the PostgreSQL and Stellar Core containers.
- Run Stellar Core with the configuration provided.

### 2. Verify the Setup

Check the status of the containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

View the logs of Stellar Core:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f stellar-core
```

- **Tip:** Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the log stream.

Verify that Stellar Core is running and connected to peers:

```bash
docker-compose exec stellar-core stellar-core http-command 'info'
```

You should see output indicating the node's status, network connections, and ledger synchronization progress.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Monitoring Tools

You can integrate additional containers for monitoring, such as Prometheus and Grafana.

**Example:**

Update `docker-compose.yml` to include monitoring services.

```yaml
services:
  # Existing services...

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Stellar Core and PostgreSQL.

### 2. Regular Maintenance

- **Updating Containers**:

  Pull the latest images and rebuild:

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

- **Backing Up Data**:

  Back up the PostgreSQL data volume.

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  tar czvf postgres_data_backup.tar.gz ./data/postgres
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- **Cleaning Up**:

  Remove unused images and containers:

  ```bash
  docker system prune -f
  ```

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Secure Your Node Seed**: Ensure `NODE_SEED` is kept confidential.
- **Docker Secrets**: Consider using Docker Secrets to manage sensitive data.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Limit access to necessary ports.

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 11625/tcp   # Stellar peer port
  sudo ufw enable
  ```

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your Docker images and host system updated.
- **SSH Security**: Use key-based authentication and disable password logins.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Containers Won't Start**: Check for errors in the Docker Compose logs.
- **Unable to Sync**: Ensure your network connection is stable and ports are open.
- **Database Errors**: Verify that the PostgreSQL container is running and accessible.
- **Stellar Core Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs stellar-core` for detailed error messages.
